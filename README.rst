PyOD is a comprehensive and scalable **Python toolkit** for **detecting outlying objects** in 
multivariate data. This exciting yet challenging field is commonly referred as 
`Outlier Detection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection>`_
or `Anomaly Detection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection>`_.
Since 2017, PyOD has been successfully used in various academic researches and
commercial products [#Kalayci2018Anomaly]_ [#Ramakrishnan2019Anomaly]_ [#Weng2019Multi]_ [#Zhao2018DCSO]_ [#Zhao2018XGBOD]_ [#Zhao2019LSCP]_.
It is also well acknowledged by the machine learning community with various dedicated posts/tutorials, including
`Analytics Vidhya <https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/02/outlier-detection-python-pyod/>`_,
`KDnuggets <https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/outlier-detection-methods-cheat-sheet.html>`_,
`Computer Vision News <https://rsipvision.com/ComputerVisionNews-2019March/18/>`_, and
`awesome-machine-learning <https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning#python-general-purpose>`_.


PyOD is featured for:


* **Unified APIs, detailed documentation, and interactive examples** across various algorithms.
* **Advanced models**\ , including **Neural Networks/Deep Learning** and **Outlier Ensembles**.
* **Optimized performance with JIT and parallelization** when possible, using `numba <https://github.com/numba/numba>`_ and `joblib <https://github.com/joblib/joblib>`_.
* **Compatible with both Python 2 & 3** (scikit-learn compatible as well).


**Important Notes**\ :
PyOD has multiple neural network based models, e.g., AutoEncoders, which are
implemented in Keras. However, PyOD would **NOT** install **Keras** and/or
**TensorFlow** for you. This reduces the risk of interfering your local copies.
If you want to use neural-net based models, please make sure Keras and a backend library, e.g., TensorFlow, are installed.
An instruction is provided: `neural-net FAQ <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/wiki/Setting-up-Keras-and-Tensorflow-for-Neural-net-Based-models>`_.
Similarly, the models depend on **xgboost**, e.g., XGBOD, would **NOT** enforce xgboost installation by default.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended to use **pip** for installation. Please make sure
**the latest version** is installed, as PyOD is updated frequently:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pyod
   pip install --upgrade pyod  # make sure the latest version is installed!
   pip install --pre pyod      # or include pre-release version for new features

Alternatively, install from github directly (\ **NOT Recommended**\ )

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod.git
   python setup.py install

**Required Dependencies**\ :


* Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7
* numpy>=1.13
* numba>=0.35
* scipy>=0.19.1
* scikit_learn>=0.19.1

**Optional Dependencies (see details below)**\ :


* Keras (optional, required for AutoEncoder)
* Matplotlib (optional, required for running examples)
* Tensorflow (optional, required for AutoEncoder, other backend works)
* XGBoost (optional, required for XGBOD)

**Known Issue 1**\ : Running examples needs Matplotlib, which may throw errors in conda
virtual environment on mac OS. See reasons and solutions `issue6 <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/issues/6>`_.

**Known Issue 2**\ : Keras and/or TensorFlow are listed as optional. However, they are
both required if you want to use neural network based models, such as
AutoEncoder. See reasons and solutions `neural-net installation <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/wiki/Setting-up-Keras-and-Tensorflow-for-Neural-net-Based-models>`_

**Known Issue 3**\ : xgboost is listed as optional. However, it is required to
run XGBOD. Users are expected to install **xgboost** to use XGBOD model.

API Cheatsheet & Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Full API Reference: (https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyod.html). API cheatsheet for all detectors:


* **fit(X)**\ : Fit detector.
* **fit_predict(X)**\ : Fit detector first and then predict whether a particular sample is an outlier or not.
* **fit_predict_score(X, y)**\ : Fit the detector, predict on samples, and evaluate the model by predefined metrics, e.g., ROC.
* **decision_function(X)**\ : Predict raw anomaly score of X using the fitted detector.
* **predict(X)**\ : Predict if a particular sample is an outlier or not using the fitted detector.
* **predict_proba(X)**\ : Predict the probability of a sample being outlier using the fitted detector.

Key Attributes of a fitted model:


* **decision_scores**\ : The outlier scores of the training data. The higher, the more abnormal.
  Outliers tend to have higher scores.
* **labels_**\ : The binary labels of the training data. 0 stands for inliers and 1 for outliers/anomalies.

To provide an overview and quick guidance of the implemented models, a benchmark
is supplied. In total, 17 benchmark data are used for comparision, all datasets could be
downloaded at `ODDS <http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/#table1>`_.

For each dataset, it is first split into 60% for training and 40% for testing.
All experiments are repeated 20 times independently with different samplings.
The mean of 20 trials are taken as the final result. Three evaluation metrics
are provided:


* The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
* Precision @ rank n (P@N)
* Execution time

Check the latest result `benchmark <https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark.html>`_.

Quick Start for Outlier Detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyOD has been well acknowledged by the machine learning community with a few featured posts and tutorials.

**Analytics Vidhya**: `An Awesome Tutorial to Learn Outlier Detection in Python using PyOD Library <https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/02/outlier-detection-python-pyod/>`_

**KDnuggets**: `Intuitive Visualization of Outlier Detection Methods <https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/outlier-detection-methods-cheat-sheet.html>`_

**Computer Vision News (March 2019)**: `Python Open Source Toolbox for Outlier Detection <https://rsipvision.com/ComputerVisionNews-2019March/18/>`_

`"examples/knn_example.py" <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/blob/master/examples/knn_example.py>`_
demonstrates the basic APIs of PyOD using kNN detector.

See `examples directory <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/blob/master/examples>`_ for more demos and more detailed instructions.
**It is noted the APIs for other algorithms are consistent/similar**.


#. Initialize a kNN detector, fit the model, and make the prediction.

   .. code-block:: python


       from pyod.models.knn import KNN   # kNN detector

       # train kNN detector
       clf_name = 'KNN'
       clf = KNN()
       clf.fit(X_train)

       # get the prediction label and outlier scores of the training data
       y_train_pred = clf.labels_  # binary labels (0: inliers, 1: outliers)
       y_train_scores = clf.decision_scores_  # raw outlier scores

       # get the prediction on the test data
       y_test_pred = clf.predict(X_test)  # outlier labels (0 or 1)
       y_test_scores = clf.decision_function(X_test)  # outlier scores

#. Evaluate the prediction by ROC and Precision@rank *n* (p@n):

   .. code-block:: python


       # evaluate and print the results
       print("\nOn Training Data:")
       evaluate_print(clf_name, y_train, y_train_scores)
       print("\nOn Test Data:")
       evaluate_print(clf_name, y_test, y_test_scores)


#. See a sample output & visualization

Quick Start for Combining Outlier Scores from Various Base Detectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"examples/comb_example.py" illustrates the APIs for combining multiple base detectors
(\ `comb_example.py <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/blob/master/examples/comb_example.py>`_\ ,
`Jupyter Notebooks <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yzhao062/pyod/master>`_\ ).

For Jupyter Notebooks, please navigate to **"/notebooks/Model Combination.ipynb"**

Given we have *n* individual outlier detectors, each of them generates an individual score for all samples.
The task is to combine the outputs from these detectors effectively
**Key Step: conducting Z-score normalization on raw scores before the combination.**
Four combination mechanisms are shown in this demo:


#. Average: take the average of all base detectors.
#. maximization : take the maximum score across all detectors as the score.
#. Average of Maximum (AOM): first randomly split n detectors in to p groups. For each group, use the maximum within the group as the group output. Use the average of all group outputs as the final output.
#. Maximum of Average (MOA): similarly to AOM, the same grouping is introduced. However, we use the average of a group as the group output, and use maximum of all group outputs as the final output.
   To better understand the merging techniques, refer to [6].

The walkthrough of the code example is provided:


#. Import models and generate sample data

   .. code-block:: python

       from pyod.models.knn import KNN
       from pyod.models.combination import aom, moa, average, maximization
       from pyod.utils.data import generate_data

       X, y = generate_data(train_only=True)  # load data

#. First initialize 20 kNN outlier detectors with different k (10 to 200), and get the outlier scores:

   .. code-block:: python

       # initialize 20 base detectors for combination
       k_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140,
                   150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200]

       train_scores = np.zeros([X_train.shape[0], n_clf])
       test_scores = np.zeros([X_test.shape[0], n_clf])

       for i in range(n_clf):
           k = k_list[i]

           clf = KNN(n_neighbors=k, method='largest')
           clf.fit(X_train_norm)

           train_scores[:, i] = clf.decision_scores_
           test_scores[:, i] = clf.decision_function(X_test_norm)

#. Then the output scores are standardized into zero mean and unit variance before combination.


   .. code-block:: python

       from pyod.utils.utility import standardizer
       train_scores_norm, test_scores_norm = standardizer(train_scores, test_scores)

#. Then four different combination algorithms are applied as described above:

   .. code-block:: python

       comb_by_average = average(test_scores_norm)
       comb_by_maximization = maximization(test_scores_norm)
       comb_by_aom = aom(test_scores_norm, 5) # 5 groups
       comb_by_moa = moa(test_scores_norm, 5)) # 5 groups

#. Finally, all four combination methods are evaluated with ROC and Precision @ Rank n:

   .. code-block:: bash

       Combining 20 kNN detectors
       Combination by Average ROC:0.9194, precision @ rank n:0.4531
       Combination by Maximization ROC:0.9198, precision @ rank n:0.4688
       Combination by AOM ROC:0.9257, precision @ rank n:0.4844
       Combination by MOA ROC:0.9263, precision @ rank n:0.4688
