Known Issues
============

This is the central place to track known issues:

1. PyOD examples depend on Matplotlib, which would throw errors in conda
virtual environment on mac OS. See `mac_matplotlib <https://github.com/yzhao062/Pyod/issues/6>`_.


Neural Networks
---------------

Neural-net installation related questions could be found: `FAQ <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/wiki/Setting-up-Keras-and-Tensorflow-for-Neural-net-Based-models>`_

SO_GAAL and MO_GAAL may only work under Python 3.5+.
